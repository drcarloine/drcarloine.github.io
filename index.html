    <h3>Aqua Anchor - 2020</h3>
<div class="projectcontent">
    <p><i>Aqua Anchor</i> is a collaborative project by myself and Aanandita Gupta.<br>In this time when most of us are experiencing increasing amounts of stress,<br> we wanted to explore whether it would be possible to recreate the calming and hypnotic effects of nature using technology.<br>

    <h3>A Journey Through The Ear - 2020</h3>
<div class="projectcontent">
<br>
    <p><i>A Journey Through The Ear</i> is a project designed for a module called Perception and Multimedia Computing.<br> We were given quite an open brief, asked to "Code an interactive sketch or app demonstrating a topic in perception.".<br> So I decided to focus on how the human ear works.<br>I created an educational app that offers adults a chance to refresh their knowledge of different parts of the ear.<br> It has a Tutorial mode that guides the user through the ear,<br>and a Quiz mode that tests their knowledge.<br>Made using openFrameworks.<br>

    <h3>Orpheus Ka Sangeet - 2019</h3>
<div class="projectcontent">
<br>
    <p><i>Orpheus Ka Sangeet</i>, a.k.a. <i>The Live Music Box</i>, is an interactive, user-dependent online experience which takes live webcam input and produces audio and visual outputs.<br>It was the collaborative final project of mine and Aanandita Gupta in the Introduction to Computational Arts Practice module. <br>The users are invited to play an instrument (guitar, drums or piano) by moving their body in front of their webcam. <br>When motion is detected in different sections of the output on the screen a corresponding sound is played. <br>The user can only see the parts of their body that is moving on screen. The movement is represented in white,<br> but the user can also choose a different colour.<br>It was our hope that the discrete representation of the user would encourage them to move more freely.<br> Created using p5.js, MaxiLib, MaxiExtras, HTML and CSS.<br>
