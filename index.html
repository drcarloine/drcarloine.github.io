<h3>A Journey Through The Ear</h3>

<h3>Orpheus Ka Sangeet</h3>
<br>
<p>Orpheus Ka Sangeet, a.k.a. The Live Music Box, is an interactive, user-dependent online experience which takes live webcam input and produces audio and visual outputs.<br>It was the final project of mine and Aanandita Gupta in the Introduction to Computational Arts Practice module. <br>The users are invited to play an instrument (guitar, drums or piano) by moving their body in front of their webcam. <br>When motion is detected in different sections of the output on the screen a corresponding sound is played. <br>The user can only see the parts of their body that is moving and it is represented in white but the user can also choose a different colour.<br> Created using p5.js, MaxiLib, MaxiExtras, HTML and CSS.<br>
